**Good First Issue** is an initiative that curates *easy-pickings* from popular open-source repositories, helping new developers take their first steps in contributing to open source.

Maintainers are eager for contributors — but beginners often feel it's hard to get started. Fixing small, beginner-friendly issues can break that barrier. That’s why this project exists.

## 🛠️ Local Development Setup

The Good First Issue project has two components:

* 🌐 A **Nuxt.js** frontend
* 🐍 A **Python** script to fetch and populate project data

To set it up locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/good-first-issue.git
cd good-first-issue
```

Make sure you have **Python 3** and a recent version of **Node.js** (or [Bun](https://bun.sh)) installed.

### 2. Prepare Sample Data

The app expects two JSON data files. Copy the provided samples:

```bash
cp data/generated.sample.json data/generated.json
cp data/tags.sample.json data/tags.json
```

> ⚠️ Without these files, the front-end app will not run.

### 3. Install Dependencies and Run

```bash
bun install        # install front-end dependencies
bun dev            # start the development server
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
